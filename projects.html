            <h3>Cinema Management System</h3>
            <p>
                The Cinema Management System is a Java application that simulates the operations of a real-world cinema. 
                The system allows customers to view movie listings, book tickets, manage profiles, order food and drinks, and manage reservations. The project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and is designed for easy scalability and maintainability.

        <h3>Simple Game Project - BlackJack and Snake</h3>
        <p>
            The following project implements a Game Manager and two games: BlackJack and Snake, using JavaFX. 
            Both games are implemented from scratch in OOP style to be fully playable. The manager also supports persistent storage for creating and logging in users to keep track of high scores across sessions. 
            The following description includes an overview, Design and Rules separate for each game, Installation Instructions, Usage, and Contributions.

        <h3>Simple RSA Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            This Python program performs RSA encryption and decryption using an interactive approach. The user is prompted to input values for two prime numbers (p and q), the public exponent (e), and the message (M) to be encrypted.
            Based on these inputs, the program calculates the following:
            <ul>
                <li>n = p * q</li>
                <li>φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)</li>
                <li>The private key d by calculating the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n)</li>
                <li>Encrypts the message M to produce ciphertext C</li>
                <li>Decrypts the ciphertext C to retrieve the original message M</li>
            </ul>
